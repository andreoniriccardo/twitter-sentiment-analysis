3130,2020-06-05 23:45:05+00:00,MatthewTurner31,@welshsnarker I think it highlights that if unis want to take distance learning and other adjustments seriously it can't just be a direct lifting of in person lectures on to lecture capture in the long term. I would suggest looking to the OU for best practice and expertise maybe?
